# Modular perfusion and motion drive for dynamic cell culture experiments
This repository contains the documentation for building and using a modular flow set-up designed to support multiple modes of dynamic cell culture. It is operable inside standard incubators without affecting internal conditions (e.g., temperature increase, contaminant formation) and is compatible with standard cell culture workflows. The described system allows three modes of perfusion or nutrient exchange for 3D cell culture models:
1.	Peristaltic pumping
  - standard method in laboratory and industrial environments,
  - enables controlled medium exchange and shear force generation,
  - suitable for adherent cultures on flat substrates and within tissue scaffolds.
2.	Wave-based rocking (wave bioreactor principle)
  - provides gentle perfusion through oscillating liquid flow in a closed system,
  - suitable for suspension cultures and tissue scaffold cultures.
3.	Rotating chamber culture
  - closed system with continuous rotation and even nutrient consumption,
  - suitable for suspension cultures and microcarrier-based cultures.
