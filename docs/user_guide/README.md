## Tilt Motor Page

### This page supports the following features

- Save scenarios for re-occurring movements.
- Import scenarios from json format.
- Export scenarios to json format.
- Reconfiguring the scenario for one-time tweaking.
- Real-time graph of motor movement.
- Homing of the motor to 0 degree position (horizontal).

![image](tilt_motor_page.png)

The **Run configuration** section enables us to configure different tilt motor movement
characteristics, such as:

- `Name` for saving the scenario.
- `Min tilt` (minimum value -20 degrees).
- `Max tilt` (maximum value 20 degrees).
- `Move duration` (in seconds).
- `Repetitions` (in seconds).
- `Standstill duration left` (standstill duration for `Min tilt` position in seconds).
- `Standstill duration horizontal` (standstill duration for `0 degree` position in seconds).
- `Standstill duration right` (standstill duration for `Max tilt` position in seconds).
- `End position` (end position of motor after finishing the movements - left/horizontal/right).
- `Microstepping` ( 1/4 step - 1/256 step).

After completing the form fields we can:

1. `Export` the scenario in JSON format, described in section
   [Import/Export Format](#tilt-importexport-format).
2. `Save scenario` to the database.
3. `Tilt motor`to trigger the motor movements.

**NOTE!** Running the scenario by clicking on `Tilt motor` without `Saving scenario` beforehand will
run the scenario without saving it to the database. The scenario will be lost on page change.

In the **Real-time Tilt Movements** Section we can view the real-time tilt movements of the motor:

- `x-axis` is the time duration of the scenario (offset from beginning in seconds).
- `y-axis` is the position of motor in degrees (min tilt - max tilt).
- `repetitions` as number of repetitions of full tilt moves in cycle.

By clicking on the **CSV** button above the movements chart, we can export the completed movements
to csv file in desired filename format:

```text
{prefix}_{scenario_name (if saved)}_{timestamp}.csv
```

![image](filename.png)

The downloaded file will have **format**:

| Timestamp (ms) | Angle |

## Peristaltic Calibration

### This page supports the following features

- Configure the peristaltic motor using flow calibration.
- Save the calibration file locally.

The **Peristaltic Motor Calibration** Guides the user through flow caliberation in 4 steps.

1. **Duration selection**

   ```text
   Choose the duration of the rotation movement for calibration.
   The unit can be selected from the dropdown menu (seconds or minutes).
   Used to calculate the slope relation between RPM and flow rate.
   ```

   ![Duration selection](calibration-duration.png)

2. **Low RPM**

   ```text
   Choose the low RPM for the calibration movement.
   After the movement is finished, measure the volume of fluid that has passed
   through the tube (in mL).
   ```

   ![Low RPM](calibration-lowrpm.png)

3. **High RPM**

   ```text
   Choose the high RPM for the calibration movement.
   After the movement is finished, measure the volume of fluid that has passed
   through the tube (in mL).
   ```

   ![High RPM](calibration-highrpm.png)

4. **File selection**

   ```text
   Choose the file name for the calibration.
   This name is used to save the calibration data.
   After clicking the "Finish Calibration" button, the data is saved to a file.
   ```

   ![File selection](calibration-slope.png)

The calibration returns a **slope** of our flow calibration, which is a linear regression function
depending on our **Low RPM Flow** and **High RPM Flow**. The calibration can eventually be used in
Peristaltic Motor Control.

### Workflow

1. Select the calibration movement duration from the dropdown.
2. Run the motor with desired Low RPM speed.
3. Input the Low RPM Volume (measured in ml).
4. Run the motor with desired High RPM speed.
5. Input the High RPM Volume (measured in ml).
6. Save the calibration file with calculated slope and calibration data.

## Peristaltic Tube Configuration

### This page supports the following features

- View all the preset tube configurations.
- Add new tube configurations.
- View all calculated flow calibrations.
- Add new flow calibrations.
- Edit the flow (mL/rotation) of existing entries.

By default, the application has 6 tube configurations preset. these will be displayed with a green
tag **Preset**. ![image](tube-configurations.png)

Additionally, we can add new tube configurations or calibrations. Depending on the type of entry,
the required form fields need to be completed.

For configuration **type** of `tube configuration`:

- field `Name` for the name of configuration to be displayed.
- field `Diameter` for the diameter of the tube.
- field `Flow Rate` for flow rate of the tube.

**NOTE!** Flow rate for tube configurations are calculated by **formula**:

```math
\frac{51}{4} \cdot \frac{\pi^2 \cdot \text{diameter}^2}{1000}
```

For configuration **type** of `flow calibration`:

- field `Duration` for movement duration during calibration.
- field `Low RPM` for speed in rotations per minute during calibration for Low RPM Volume.
- field `High RPM` for speed in rotations per minute during calibration for High RPM Volume.
- field `Low RPM Volume` for measured flow volume after the calibration duration period.
- field `High RPM Volume` for measured flow volume after the calibration duration period.đ
- field `Filename` for desired filename under which the calibration is saved.
